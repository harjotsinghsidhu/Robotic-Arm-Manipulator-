# Robotic-Arm-Manipulator-

Robotic arm programmed in C++ with use of pulse width modulation to complete a full functioning robotic manipulator. Used three servo motors for three degrees of freedom, push buttons and potentiometers to adjust specific angles of the motors. Once angles are set, I ran a loop with case statements for the arm to move along the set planned path.
